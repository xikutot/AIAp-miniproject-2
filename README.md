# AI Applications miniproject 2

This small ML project was carried out as part of the AI Application module at OST in the spring semester 2024 by Leo Oetterli and Sylvester Homberger.

The requirements can be found [here](./admin/AiAp24_MiniProj2_Requirements.pdf). Basically, we had to find our own labeled image data, train 2 DNNs of different complexity, and analyze all results. Our final report can be found [here](./products/Leo_Oetterli_und_Sylvester_Homberger_AIAp_Miniproject2.pdf).

To run our [notebook](./products/Leo_Oetterli_und_Sylvester_Homberger_AIAp_Miniproject2.ipynb) the packages in our [setup-script](./admin/conda-setup-script.sh) have to be installed.
